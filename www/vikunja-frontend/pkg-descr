Vikunja is todo-app written in go.
Stay organized by categorizing tasks into projects and creating hierarchical
subprojects to keep related items together. Collaborate seamlessly with peers,
allowing easy project sharing with individuals or entire teams. Assign tasks to
specific individuals for clear accountability. Customize your experience by
choosing different views, such as the classic list view, Gantt view for time
management, Table view for comprehensive details, or Kanban for an overview of
the status of all ongoing tasks.
